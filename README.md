# Fake-News-Detection-System-

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages various classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to identify whether a given piece of news is real or fake.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib (for visualizations, if applicable)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two CSV files containing news articles labeled as "Fake" or "Real":
- `Fake.csv`: Contains fake news articles.
- `True.csv`: Contains real news articles.
